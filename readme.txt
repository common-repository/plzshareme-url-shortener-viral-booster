== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How is this plugin better than other URL Shorteners? =
How many other URL Shorteners will promote your content just for using their shortener? Will they promote your content on their social media to help get you traffic? Can you view general total click stats in your website instead of logging into theirs? and can you do all this for free? This is what makes our plugin better.

= How do i increase views to my YouTube, Vine, Vimeo or DailyMotion video? =
First, shorten your link on your website to your post that includes your video. Second, log into your account on http://plzshare.me and submit a link for your video on YouTube, Vine, etc. This new shortened link will create a landing page containing your video. Because you shortened this link in your account, we will promote both your website and the shortened video link giving you more views to your videos.

= Do I need to show the social links to have my content promoted? =
No, just sync your API Key to the plugin so your posts are shortened and tracked. We'll see your content get shortened. The shortened icons are optional.

= I use a Bit.ly shortener (or the Jetpack plugin) to shorten my links. Can I still use the PlzShareMe plugin to have my content promoted? =
Absolutely! The PlzShareMe url shortener works with other shorteners too like Bit.ly and others. You'll come to find out these other shorteners just shorten and do nothing else for you. We go far beyond and actually promote your content that will send you traffic. Simply follow the installation directions and you're all set. Nothing else needs to be done.

= How often will my posts get shared and boosted? =
We share content daily. Expect your content to get shared within 1-3 days after it's published. We choose 1 random post every day to advertise ("boost") on social media. This post, like all our shared content, links directly to your site using your plzshare.me link. As a result, you'll see your content get much more attention more frequently.
